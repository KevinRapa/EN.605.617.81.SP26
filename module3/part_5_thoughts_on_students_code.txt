Problems I see with student's code:

1. Allocates the host buffers on the stack - there won't be enough stack memory to support high data volumes (in the millions)
   Not inherently a problem, just a notable limitation in my opinion.

2. Uses std::chrono to measure kernel execution time. I don't think this is the best way to measure because the kernel runs
   asynchonously from the CPU. It will also include overhead time from calling the kernel. There is the device function
   clock() that can be used, or kernel events. 

3. Does not synchonize with the GPU device before taking the end time. The kernel wil return immediately so the student isnt
   actually measuring any code execution at all.

4. Lastly, assuming what the `add` function does, this probably does not demonstrate the impact of branching on kernel
   efficiency.
